description: 'Starting his design career in the era of ink-on-paper, Greg has worked within the disciplines of corporate identity, magazine art direction and advertising. He transitioned into animation and interface design during the heyday of interactive CD-ROM development. Subsequent advances in computer processing power allowed Greg to adopt digital-3D modeling and animation for video productions. Then the web became a "thing". Lessons learned from his print, interactive and animation days were combined to inform his passion for front-end web development. Greg has recently transitioned away from client work and is now pursuing his interests in front-end web technology. Currently residing in Chicago area with his wife, they dream of relocating to the mountains of North Carolina where Boon Ai can raise her chickens.'   # Tell us a bit about yourself
