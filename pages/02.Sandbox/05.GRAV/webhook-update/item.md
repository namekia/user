###Revised approach to configuration

OK, the first time I tried the GitHub automatic webhook it didn't work out so well. The intent is to automatically upload to the production server any changes or additions made to items located in `/user` folder. Although it seemed to function properly at first, my initial attempt failed completely after a Grav update.

This time I&rsquo;ve re-configured the webhook to only upload items that reside in the `/user` directory. As of yesterday afternoon it seems to be working. I'll try to document the steps taken during the configuration process. I say _attempt_ because I spent a good deal of time whacking the configuration with a blunt stick.

The **big take-away** is that the file `___github-webrefresh.php` had to be placed in the root folder NOT `/user` as I had originally suspected.

Although the doc is quite old at this point, I made significant use of Andy Miller&rsquo;s article on [Grav Development with GitHub](https://getgrav.org/blog/developing-with-github-part-2).

Note that the following details assume that:
1. a functioning website has already been set up and is running on `localhost`
1. a GithHub account has already been established

###From localhost to GitHub.com

Open your GitHub desktop client and click on the **+** button located in upper-left corner. The click on the **Add** tab. Final step is to supply the path the `/user` folder. The localhost site will be resinding in `C:\MAMP\htdocs`. This is step one. We next need to to **Publish** this repository to GitHub.com.
